## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Amanda Hotvedt
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 4-5
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](https://www.nhl.com/).
* What gave you the most trouble: 

I have not yet figured out how to make my radio button for the shiny app functional. 

* Any comments you have:

There is still much more that I can do with the data, so I will work on adding more visuals and summary statistics over the next week. I am having trouble figuring out how to arrange certain summary outputs in descending or ascending order, so I will work on that as well.


## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

profiles <- profiles %>%
  mutate(is_female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0))

profiles_less <- profiles %>% 
  select(orientation, is_female, income, job)

#Average Income in Full Data Set

profiles_less %>% 
  summarise("Avg Income" = mean(income))

#Average Income without "-1" values

profiles_less2 <- profiles_less %>% 
  filter(income != -1) 

profiles_less2 %>% 
  summarise("Adjusted Avg Income" = mean(income))

ggplot(data=profiles_less2, aes(x=income)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000)

#Average Income by Gender

profiles_less2 %>% 
  group_by(is_female) %>% 
  summarise("Avg Income By Gender" = mean(income))

ggplot(data=profiles_less2, aes(x=income, y=..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 20000) + facet_wrap(~is_female)

#Average Incombe by Job

profiles_less2 %>% 
  group_by(job) %>% 
  summarise("Avg Income By Job" = mean(income)) 

#Gender Proportions by Job

profiles_less2 %>% 
  group_by(job) %>% 
  summarise("Gender Prop by Job" = mean(is_female))


#Average Income by Job and Gender

profiles_less2 %>% 
  group_by(job, is_female) %>% 
  summarise("Avg Income By Job and Gender" = mean(income)) %>% 
  spread(key=is_female, value= "Avg Income By Job and Gender")

#Gender Proportions by Orientation

profiles_less2 %>% 
  group_by(orientation) %>% 
  summarise("Gender Prop by Job" = mean(is_female))

#Average Incombe by Orientation

profiles_less2 %>% 
  group_by(orientation) %>% 
  summarise("Avg Income By Orientation" = mean(income)) 

```



## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
