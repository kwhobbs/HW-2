## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Amanda Hotvedt
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 7
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/khobbs/).
* What gave you the most trouble: 

* Any comments you have:

After our discussion about making smaller buckets for the income variable (ex. high income, medium income, low income), I tried to use fct_recode like I did with the religion variable to group the categorial variables. While I understand it conceptually, I wasn't able to get the code to work. 

## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

mean(profiles$is_female)


#The line at y=0.40 on the plot is added as a reference tool, indicating the proportion of female respondents in the entire sample. 

```
Notes:

-43.4% of respondents who did not report their income were female. This gender distribution is not drastically different from the overall proportion of female respondents, 40%. Therefore, reporting income is not a strong predictor of gender.

-The average female income is 86,633, significatly lower than the average male income of 110,984. Therefore, income can be a strong predictor of sex. Overall, the distribution of female incomes is shifted slightly farther to the left than the distribution of male incomes. Grouping the income variable into bigger buckets, for example into  high, medium, and low income, would simplify the model. 

-Many jobs have gender distributions significantly different than the overall proportion of female respondents, 0.40. Therefore, depending on the specific job, job can be a moderate to strong predictor of sex.

-Religion can also be a strong predictor of sex, depending on the specific religion. For religions with proportions of females close to 0.40, religion is not a powerful predictor of gender. On the other hand, for religions with proportions of females far from 0.40, religion is a powerful predictor of gender. For example, Islam is 26.6% women, compared to the overal 40% of respondents, indicating that religion is a strong predictor of sex for those who reported Islam. However, only 139 users reported Islam. Therefore, it is a strong predictor of sex for a very small subset of the population. It might not be worth including a separate coefficient for Islam in the model. In contrast, Christianity would be a moderately strong predictor of sex for a larger subset of people, and therefore might be more valuable to include in the model. Overall, it is important to note that 20,226 people did not report a religion and not reporting religion is not a strong predictor of sex, since the gender breakdown for that subset is very close to 0.40. 


## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
